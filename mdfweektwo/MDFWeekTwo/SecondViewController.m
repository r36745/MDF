And given perhaps the most remarkable disclaimer ever -- the program features dramatic reenactments based on eyewitness accounts, testimonials and the legend of the Amish Mafia -- one might rightfully view this as high camp as opposed to anything remotely approaching reality. By that measure, sister network Discovery's latest attempt to exploit the non-TV-watching Amish is either a shark-jumping example of structured reality hitting its nadir, or in its brazenness, the screwball comedy of 2012.\n\n";

For The Americans' undercover KGB agents Philip (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell), though, those things are all on the daily to-do list. The thrill of the series, created by former CIA agent Joe Weisberg, is in watching the Jenningses maintain their 1980s suburban charade while living across the street from an FBI agent (Noah Emmerich) whose job is to uncover the Russians in our midst. Plus, they get to wear elaborate costumes and kick serious assâ€”it is a spy show, after all. The second season of the FX drama, premiering Feb. 26 at 10 p.m., will find the couple struggling to protect their two young children from their increasingly dangerous jobs.\n\n";
